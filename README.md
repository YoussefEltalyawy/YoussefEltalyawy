### 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I'm Yousef — a 15-year-old full-stack developer and designer building my path with pure drive, late nights, and the kind of ambition that doesn't fit in a school desk. I'm from **Giza, Egypt**, but my mind is always somewhere between design docs and code editors, chasing big ideas.


Whether it's working on my own projects like [Medu](https://github.com/YousefEltalyawy?tab=repositories&q=old-medu), or pitching local brands through my solo studio [**Talyawy.dev**](https://talyawy.vercel.app/), I'm all in.

### 🧠 What Drives Me?

I’m building the future I wish I had — one where tech meets design, clarity meets emotion, and creativity isn't sacrificed for functionality.

No fluff. No templates. Just solid work, bold vision, and the will to grow every single day.

---

### 🔧 What I Work With
- **Frontend:** Next.js · React · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase · Prisma · PostgreSQL · REST
- **Design:** Figma · Blender (still exploring 👀)
- **Extras:** Auth with Kinde, Clerk, and Auth.js · UI Animations · Clean, component-driven architecture

---

### 💡 What I'm Into
- Turning vague ideas into real apps
- Building clean, scalable systems that feel *right*
- Working with creators, dreamers, and bold minds
- Learning everything from app dev to philosophy

### 🧭 TL;DR?

**Young but deadly.** I design like an artist, code like an engineer, and dream like a founder.

Let’s build something that matters. 🚀
